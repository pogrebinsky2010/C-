Image processor is a compilation of about 5 filters each adding a new feature being able to edit image input files with the
desired filters. 
this includes: Demand driven execution, picture manipulation with easily customizable changes, a logger for every filter, 
and a working make file for easy execution.

To compile this program simply use the makefile provided.

Then to execute input an image by passing it in as the first argument and the second 
argument should be the desired name of the output image for 
Example: "./proj3F "Your image file" > "output image name"

More notes: this program runs great on Mac operating systems, last ran November 15th 2017 on a mac with highsierra.

Also ran on Ubuntu 14, the only changes I had to apply was changing angle brackets to quotes in the includes,
however this change wasnt neccesary after re-downloading the program. 
If an error occurs which states a inclusion is not found simply apply this change.
If an error is recieved that "class is not identified" then you may need to change 
the .C files and .c file to .cpp to let the compiler know it is using C++, however 
if ran on a proper system no changes are neccesary.
