Image processor is a compilation of about 5 of my programs each adding a new feature, this includes: Demand driven execution, picture manipulation with easily customizable changes, a logger for every filter, and a working make file for easy execution.

To compile this program simply use "make" to create the output file "proj3F.o"
Then to execute use: "./proj3F 3F_input.pnm > output.pnm"

Note: 3F_input.pnm is a picture being passed into the program whereas > is saying to output the file, if > is not specified the program will still run.

More notes: this program runs great on Mac operating systems, last ran November 15th 2017 on a mac with highsierra and it ran well.

Also ran on Ubuntu 14, the only changes I had to apply was changing angle brackets to quotes in the includes, however this change wasnt neccesary after re-downloading the program. A small change I made may have caused this, either way if you get an error that a inclusion is not found simply apply this change.
If an error is recieved that "class is not identified" then you may need to change the .C files and .c file to .cpp to let the compiler know it is using C++, however if ran on a proper system no changes are neccesary.
